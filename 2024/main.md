# Hello Open Alliance!
Welcome to Team 9496 Lynk's 2024 OA thread! We are a community based rookie team (first year as a team, and first year as an Open Alliance team :astonished:).

## About Us 
Lynk is a newly formed high school FIRST Robotic Competition (FRC) team, operating under the umbrella of the Inspire Carolina, Inc non-profit organization. We believe that FRC is a powerful program that can challenge and grow the high school students in our region, and have a positive impact on our community. We're a community team based out of Rutherford County North Carolina, serving the whole region and we're welcoming to all students who are in 9-12 grade (14-18 years old).
