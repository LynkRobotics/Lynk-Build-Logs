SCRIW

we should talk about how we let everyone on the team try something new like new drivers new media and ect. 
this was a really fun meet for everyone to learn and for the new poeple on our team can see what is going on during the meets. 
everyone on our team did a amazing job i am ready for the next season to come.
we also ranked 7th in scriw with a record of 8-4-0 and we competed in the playoffs as the 1st Pick of Alliance 1 and won the event.
our team was 4451, us 9496, 3489, 8575 and we did really good :)
