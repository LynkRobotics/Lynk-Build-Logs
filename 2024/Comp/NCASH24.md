We were lucky to be only a little over an hour drive from the venue for this event. Though it did not have a free breakfast buffet (which was a bummer), we are so grateful for our mentors, the McEntireâ€™s who helped us in the pinch and ran out and provided breakfast for the team from Sam's Club. It was a different experience than our previous event where we had the airbnb, but we all still got good sleep for the weekend and plenty of meeting space for strategy sessions.
