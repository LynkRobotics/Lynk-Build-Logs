I’m one of the founding mentors of LYNK, and as a rookie team, we’ve worked hard to develop systems to help our team stay organized and effective. Now that we’re heading into our second season, we’re building on what we’ve learned and want to share some of these resources in case they’re helpful to other teams. Here’s a quick overview of some things that have been most impactful for us so far:

</span></h2>
</div>

Having experience with Canva, we decided to use it to design our //business plan and //brand guide. Canva gave us the flexibility to make the two documents visually appealing while still being collaborative, allowing everyone to contribute. 
To help structure our business plan, we used resources from //FIRST’s Fundraising Toolkit and researched documentation from high-performing teams.
Students reviewed various branding documents/guides from real-world companies and again, other high-performing teams, as part of the process to curate our own brand guide. This exercise not only helped us establish our team’s identity but also taught our students valuable skills for the future.

Managing food for events was a learning curve in our rookie season, but we’ve since developed a system that works well for our team. Here’s what it looks like - we have a simple schedule that looks something like this for each event:

- Boxed Lunches:</strong> For event days, we order boxed lunches for team members, which simplifies meal distribution. See below about organizing these effectively!

- Catered Dinners:</strong> Friday nights, we bring in catering to the hotel, and on Saturday nights we bring in pizza—quick, easy, and a crowd-pleaser. Bonus: it’s also great for grab-and-go during strategy meetings, even if it’s room temp by the end of the night!
<br>
Also, if we have some catering left over from the previous night that a mentor has taken to their room, this is the time that can get eaten up since we check out Sunday morning.

More on Boxed Lunches and effective organization: we’ve refined our process for organizing food orders by creating a Google Form where team members submit their meal preferences. From there, we export the data to an Avery.com mailing label template and print labels with each person’s name and their chosen meal. This system ensures everyone gets their food and throughout the meal timeframe we can all know who hasn't had time to come out and eat their lunch by just seeing what meals are left and reading their labels. The process of actually labeling the meals takes all of 5 min at the event before we start handing the meals out to team members and looks something like this:

We don’t organize breakfasts as part of our food plan because that’s something we prioritize when choosing hotels. Here are the three main factors we consider when booking team accommodations:


<div>
<div align="left">
<bd><strong><span style="color:#bf5700">
1. Drive Distance to the Venue:</strong>  We aim for hotels within a 15-minute drive of the event venue.
</span></bd>
</div>

<div>
<div align="left">
<bd><strong><span style="color:#bf5700">
2. Breakfast:</strong>  Breakfast must be included in the room pricing to simplify morning logistics.
</span></bd>
</div>

<div>
<div align="left">
<bd><strong><span style="color:#bf5700">
3. Budget:</strong> We keep an eye on costs, including parking fees, although parking hasn’t been a major factor for most of our events.
</span></bd>
</div>

<br>

<div>

To stay organized, we’ve created //this document to track our hotel options, preferences, and details. A big part of our planning involves securing what’s often referred to as 
<strong><span style="color:#bf5700">
"Courtesy" or "Non-Attrition" </strong> 
room blocks - these blocks don’t bind us to pay for unused rooms, as long as they’re canceled within the negotiated timeframe (usually 24-48 hours before the event)! We also block enough rooms so that family members of team members can book within the same block if they’d like to stay with the team.

We understand that these are all background logistics, but we truly believe they play a crucial role in enhancing the team’s overall experience and ensuring everything runs smoothly. We’re excited to continue improving these systems and hope this post helps other teams who are just starting or looking for new ideas. Feel free to ask questions and share your own tips—we’d love to learn from you, too!
