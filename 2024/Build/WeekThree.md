After doing some testing with this intake we noticed that the front wheel wasn't pulling the note in and this was due to it being 2” off the ground, we decided to try moving it down by ⅛” also this version seemed to have to much compression and we moved to 1.625” spacing between wheels. Another note is that the idler shaft on top would occasionally pull a note in and bind it into the intake.

We worked on battery connectors. We are using 2awg cable for our battery connectors, following fellow NC OA [Team 900 The Zebracorns](https://www.chiefdelphi.com/t/the-zebracorns-behind-the-stripes-design-code-and-build-blog-2023-2024/440094?u=jimmyy) successes in their whitepaper [ZebraPower 2.0](https://www.chiefdelphi.com/t/zebrapower-2-0-the-zebracornss-battery-paper-update/440093?u=jimmyy)

We finished the final sheet metal design for the intake over the weekend and prepared the files to be sent out to our sponsor for manufacturing along with the belly pan, and some mounting hardware.
