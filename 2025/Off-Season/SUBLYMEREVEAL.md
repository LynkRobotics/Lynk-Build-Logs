Last year at Chezy Champs, we had the incredible honor of sharing our Latch bumpers with Citrus Circuits as they built a clone of our 2024 season robot. (We like to think they may have even picked up a few notes from how we built our bumpers!)

Fast forward to this year: at Worlds, Citrus turned the tables and handed us their practice bumpers—effectively challenging us to return the favor and build a clone of their robot.

After a lot of consideration, analysis, and long conversations, we decided to go for it. And so, SUBLYME was born—a Citrus Circuits– one-to-one clone, built with the goal of competing with it at Chezy Champs this year.

Our first test event for SUBLYME will be this Saturday at SCRAP, giving us a chance to warm up and put our build through its paces before Chezy Champs.

We can’t wait to see how it performs—and to share the field once again with the teams who inspire us.
