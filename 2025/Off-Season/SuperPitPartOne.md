Back in 2024, we picked our toolbox with the plan of building a Super Pit one day. After seeing what 4414 did with Omega Cases, we decided it was time to go for it.

We placed the order with Omega in March 2025, and everything shipped out by May 2025. The cases came securely packaged, crated, and built — we just rolled them off the trailer and into the build room.

We’re currently waiting on the super structure and work surface to complete the setup, but even now it’s a huge upgrade. Everything’s organized, mobile, and getting ready for comp season.

Big thanks to Omega cases for the timely delivery. We’ll share more once it’s all together.
