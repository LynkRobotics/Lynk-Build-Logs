The first step in being competitive is to stop dying on the field and become a reliable bot.

To ensure we build robust and quality robots that do not die on the field mid match, we have made an ongoing document with LYNK specific best practices. This document is live and will be constantly updating as we learn more.

This document covers things like wiring practices, design ideologies, assembly, etc.

Some practices in this document are inspired and or stolen from other teams, sometimes you just have to steal from the best, and invent the rest.
