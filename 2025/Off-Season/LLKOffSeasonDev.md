Hello everyone,

I wanted to provide an update on the LLK, as it has been a while since the last one.

This year, the LLK has been rewritten from the ground up. While the site's navigation remains the same, it has been simplified to make long-term maintenance easier. One major change is that all documents on the LLK are now stored in our team drive and will not link to other teams' websites. This decision was made because links often become inactive when teams rewrite or reorganize their sites, so storing everything in our drive will prevent that issue.

In 2024, we had 21,000 unique visits to the LLK from various locations, averaging about 58 visits per day. That's incredible, and I'm thrilled to see that people find this tool valuable! So far in 2025, we have had approximately 9,000 visits. We would love to hear feedback from frequent users on how we can improve the LLK!

Additionally, the LLK is looking for more content to addâ€”this could include workshops, technical binders, whitepapers, codebases, or anything else. Please submit your contributions [here](https://github.com/LynkRobotics/Lynk-Library-of-Knowledge/issues/new/choose).
