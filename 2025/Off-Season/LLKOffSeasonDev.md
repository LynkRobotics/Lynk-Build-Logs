<h2><span style="color:#bf5700">Development Update</span></h2>
</div>

Hello, I thought I would provide an update on the LLK since it has been a while since the last one.

The LLK was rewritten from the ground up this year. Nothing really changes the site's navigation; it is just simplified, so maintaining this project long-term is easy.

In 2024, we had 21k different visits to the LLK from various places, which is about 58 visits a day. That is insane, and I am glad people enjoy this tool. So far in 2025, we have ~9k visits! 

The LLK is looking for some more content to add, whether that be workshops, technical binders, code bases, or anything! Submit anything and everything [here](https://github.com/LynkRobotics/Lynk-Library-of-Knowledge/issues/new/choose).
