Over the weekend at GAGAI in Gainesville, GA, a few people mentioned that our bumpers looked impressive! We really appreciate the kind words and wanted to take a moment to share our process. This year, with updates to the manual and advice from [other teams](https://www.chiefdelphi.com/t/bumper-fabric-how-to-make-your-own-bumper-numbers/400684?u=jimmyy), we made a few key upgrades. 

Key Differences This Year:
- Solid core pool noodles ‚Üí Floor tiles glued with contact cement (hidden surprise)
    - Even though someone was inspired by our bumpers from last year‚Ä¶. (insert our 2024 bumpers and citrus 2025 bumpers) [MAKE THIS A SPOILER SECTION]
- Random iron-on vinyl ‚Üí Siser iron-on vinyl

Here are a few highlights of this post:

Our Process & Materials:
üîó [CAD files](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/a7d2d5e538dd38473eb929a3/w/55ace61918957b17aaeeab7e/e/083487f55b9fad55bbb18d23?configuration=List_sObwiVVGarXU1z%3DFloor_Tile&renderMode=0&uiState=67c9d0005d541237256bd9d2) configurable to your robot bumpers

ü™µ We use [this wood](https://www.lowes.com/pd/ReliaBilt/5002107583), which we CNC cut for accuracy

üßµ Bumper fabric: [1000D Cordura](https://www.seattlefabrics.com/60-1000-D-Cordura-Nylon-1895-linear-yard_p_53.html)

Number Material: [Siser iron-on Vinyl](https://a.co/d/9efIi6i)

üõ†Ô∏è Foam: [These tiles](https://www.harborfreight.com/4-piece-anti-fatigue-foam-mat-set-94635.html) layered and glued together with [this contact cement](https://www.lowes.com/pd/DAP-Weldwood-Off-White-Contact-Cement-Construction-Adhesive-Actual-Net-Contents-128-Fl-Oz/3033218)

üìå Fastening: [Dewalt Stapler](https://a.co/d/imk9EOg) - This actually makes the stapling process a breeze!

After switching to this new bumper setup, we had a few questions we wanted to answer for ourselves. Here‚Äôs what we found:

<div>
<div align="left">
<h3><span style="color:#bf5700">1Ô∏è‚É£ How did the new foam perform?</span></h3>
</div>

We were initially concerned that the foam might be too rigid, but it held up great! Despite being more firm, it didn‚Äôt cause any mechanical damage to our robot‚Äîthanks in part to a super stout design this year. We layered the floor tiles on top of each other, glued them together with contact cement, let them cure, and then cut them to shape with a bandsaw. This created a vertically stacked foam structure that wraps around the robot.

<h3><span style="color:#bf5700">2Ô∏è‚É£ How did the new number material hold up?
</span></h3>
</div>

Last year, we used a random brand of iron-on vinyl for our bumper numbers. This year, we did some research and found [this Siser material](https://a.co/d/9efIi6i), which came highly recommended by the FRC community. It‚Äôs thinner, which helps it ‚Äúmelt into‚Äù the fabric better. We did have to re-iron a few corners, but a quick heat gun fix (pressing the side of the heat gun on for like less than 5 seconds) worked like a charm!

<div>
<div align="left">
<h3><span style="color:#bf5700">3Ô∏è‚É£ Squared vs. Rounded Corners?
</span></h3>
</div>

We debated whether squared-off corners might help clear coral more effectively vs. rounded corners that may give us an advantage during defence. While we haven‚Äôt tested this in-depth, our current chassis design‚Äîa low rider this year‚Äîhas helped keep algae from getting under the robot. With good driving and a program offset for obstacle handling, we haven‚Äôt seen a need for rounded corners yet. We don‚Äôt see an explicit need to round out the corners on our bumpers this year, we played many cycles at our first event with defense being played on our end of the field and with our L2 SDS swerve modules, we don‚Äôt see a major need to change the bumpers.

<h3><span style="color:#bf5700">4Ô∏è‚É£ Did our bumper mounting system work well?
</span></h3>
</div>

Our mounting system is definitely tight, which has been a good thing for overall robot safety! The one challenge is that getting the bumpers over the mounts can be a bit tricky. We wrap the fabric double-thick on the back side of our bumper support material, folding it from top-down, stapling that in place, and then bottom-up and stapling that in place so that every time the bumpers go on and off the robot, it isn't pushing the material off the bumper frame, rather the downward force is basically pushing the material even more up.

Here are a few pictures of the process of our bumpers:

<h2><span style="color:#bf5700">New Foam - IRON DIRECTLY ON THE NEW FOAM?!?!
</span></h2>
</div>

For some, this might not seem like a big deal‚Äîbut for those who‚Äôve **agonized** over bumper-making, this is a game-changer.

If you‚Äôve ever measured your bumper numbers like **9,496 times** to ensure they‚Äôre straight, only to **tack, re-tack, and stress over ironing**, you know the struggle. This year, we discovered that with the **new foam tiles, we can staple the fabric first and then iron directly onto it‚Äîwithout melting the foam!!!**

This small change eliminates wrinkles, reduces stress, and saves time. Now, we can simply cut the fabric to size, staple it down smoothly, and iron the numbers on exactly where they belong‚Äîwithout second-guessing.

A small tweak, but a huge improvement!
