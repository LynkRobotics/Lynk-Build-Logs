I would still recommend to new teams to use things like [YAGSL](https://www.chiefdelphi.com/t/yagsl-2025-a-leap-forward-in-swerve-drive-control-and-simulation/476005?u=jimmyy) or [CTRE's swerve generator](https://v6.docs.ctr-electronics.com/en/2024/docs/tuner/tuner-swerve/index.html) as they have ongoing community support, but this is here as an option, and what we use currently.
