<h2><span style="color:#bf5700">Potential Robot Archetypes</span></h2>
</div>

### Purpose
- List examples of robots to execute specific game strategies
- Focus on robot capabilities, not much on mechanisms
- Trying to build a robot that does everything will probably lead to failure
- Think broadly, and not too deep -- we want diverse ideas!
- Things to think about:
    - What does the robot need to do in auto?  (programs? sensors? tasks?)
    - How does the robot interact with game pieces?
    - What attributes are needed (robust, speed, power, agility, etc)?

### The Robots
#### Magic Carpet
    Description:
    - Just a magic carpet, the brave little toaster, the andymark chassis
    Pros:
    - Moves
    - Could play defense
    Cons:
    - Doesn’t score game pieces (maybe an algae)
#### Coral Cycler
    Description:
    - Stays on one side and cycles coral only
    Pros: 
    - Gets the Coral RP
    - Fast
    Cons:
    - Parks, but does not climb
    - One Trick Pony
#### Algae Cycler
    Description:
    - Just cycles algae (to processor – maybe into net)
    - Can de-algaefy the reef
    Pros:
    - Scores algae
    - Coopertition Bonus
    - Free up the reef for Coral
    Cons:
    - One trick pony
    - No climb
    - Might run out of algae
#### The Wall
    Description:
    - Deploys wide and high to block human player shots especially
    - Might be able to score algae into processor
    Pros: 
    - Prevents 4-point from HP after 6-point processor score
    - Could potentially re-score missed Algae
    Cons:
    - Limited flexibility
    - Might be top-heavy
    - Might run out of algae to defend against
    - Might not actually be able to get between human player and barge net
    - Might take a lot of time just to do nothing
    - Touching the net by accident would be a major foul
#### RP Bot
    Description:
    - Can score 2 Algae into Processor for Coopertition, but barely
    - Can shore Coral onto the Reef, though not the best
    - Can deep climb
    Pros:
    - Does just enough for Coral RP 
    - Doesn’t need to dealgaefy reef
    Cons:
    - Needs to be able to do L4
    - Not great by itself – needs help to secure the win
    - Complexity of deep climbing
    - Each RP is just ⅓ of a win, not ½
    - RP is not a benefit in playoffs 
#### KitBot
    Description:
    - The Kit Bot
    Pros:
    - Can score on L1
    - Lots of coral can fit on L1
    Cons:
    - No swerve
    - Can’t score on other levels
    - Can’t manipulate algae (without modification)
#### Hopper Bot (not Marie)
    Description:
    - Receives coral from KitBot
    Pros:
    - Let’s the KitBot do most of the cycling; score on Coral more quickly
    - Can score more on higher levels when paired with KitBot
    - Cons:
    - Capability wasted when not paired with non-KitBot
#### Defense Bot
    Description: 
    - Goes to other side of the field to slow down opponent offense
    - Maybe could dealgaefy the opponent reef and bring algae across field
    - Strong & robust for defense
    Pros:
    - Points are comparative - if they can’t score, they can’t win
    - Can give alliance more algae to score
    Cons:
    - Cannot score itself
#### Coral Front & Back
    Description: 
    - Can intake Coral from opposite site of scoring on reef
    - Can be fed Coral from Coral Station without needing to travel to Coral Station
    Pros: 
    - Cuts down on cycle times by removing distance to travel
    - Doesn’t rule out also scoring algae
    Cons: 
    - Complexity and maintenance
#### The California Powerhouse Bot
    Description: 
    - Does everything
    Pros:
    - No limitations
    Cons: 
    - You’ve gotta be one of those teams to pull it off
#### The Annoying Bot
    Description:
    - Wide
    - Gets in front of a Coral Station (or processor) and denies access
    Pros:
    - Can shut down a Coral Station completely (or processor)
    Cons:
    - There are two Coral Stations
    - Cannot score points itself
    - Needs to survive contact with deep cages
#### The Shooter Bot
    Description:
    - Shoots coral onto the reef
    Pros:
    - Doesn’t need to move around reef to score on other branches
    - Points for EI
    Cons:
    - Complexity / reliability of shooting from distance
#### The Climbing Bot
    Description:
    - Focused on ensuring the deep cage climb
    - Might push algae around a bit, but put most development effort into climb
    Pros:
    - Always gets the Barge RP
    Cons:
    - Does little otherwise to contribute to offense
#### Mediocre California Powerhouse
    Description: 
    - Does a little bit of everything but doesn't do it well 
    Pros:
    - Versatile
    - May help with RP
    Cons: 
    - Inefficient
