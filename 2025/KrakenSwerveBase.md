<h1><span style="color:#bf5700">Base Kraken Swerve Release</span></h1>
</div>

Hello! This is the public release of the swerve base I have maintained for ~3 years now.

I would still reccomend if you have all CTRE hardware, to use CTRE's [Swerve Generator](https://v6.docs.ctr-electronics.com/en/2024/docs/tuner/tuner-swerve/index.html)

<div align="left">
<h2><span style="color:#bf5700">Features</span></h2>
</div>

- Made for all CTRE hardware
- CANivore Support
- FOC Support
- Support for all SDS and some WCP modules
    - WCP Swerve X support only (with Swerve XS and other support coming soon)
- Simple and barebones

<div align="left">
<h2><span style="color:#bf5700">Features Coming Soon (Post Season) </span></h2>

- 250hz Odom Thread (CANivore Only)

<h2><span style="color:#bf5700">Final Notes </span></h2>

I would still reccomend to new teams to use things like [YAGSL](https://www.chiefdelphi.com/t/yagsl-2025-a-leap-forward-in-swerve-drive-control-and-simulation/476005?u=jimmyy) or [CTRE's swerve generator](https://v6.docs.ctr-electronics.com/en/2024/docs/tuner/tuner-swerve/index.html) as they have ongoing community support, but this is here as an option, and what we use currently.
